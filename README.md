## <b>Notes</b><br>
A Mobirise Bootstrap menu with many configuration settings available from the "gear" configuration icon. It includes:
- Individual colour and opacity settings for Main, Sub and Hamburger menu background.
- Individual underline colour and thickness for main and sub-menu plus sub-menu % darken on hover.
- Options to enable Buttons, Social icons and Brand Name text within the menu plus controls set the dispaly area width of each.
- Set Logo size & Set logo size when scrolling down page options.
- Allows alignment of main menu when is desktop mode to eitehr left, center or right. Menu item spacing slider also provided.
- Menu undrline options.
- Main Menu and Sub Menu underline options.
- Sub Menu rounded corner optons.
- Main and Sub Menu Box shadow (inner and outer) options.
- A top line message - with various configuration options available.

In summary, you can configure more options on the gear icon than you can with the standard menus. This was a personal training exercise for me to configure gear items and also upload to GitHub.

## <b>Installation and use</b><br>
From v2.6 onwards a Mobirise extension (mbrext) file is provided. To install the extension in the Mobirise Builder follow these steps:
- Select the "Extensions" option from the left hand main menu
- Select "import"
- Browse to the downloaded MobiGaryExtension .mrext file and select "IMPORT ANYWAY" at the unknown source warning
- Once the extension is installed it will show in the catalogue of installed extensions. If you hover ovedr the installed extension it will show version information.
- To use blocks within the extension locate the "MobiGary" category on the Block-Add screen. Currently this extension contains only one block, the MobiGary Menu. Drag the block onto a project to use.
Note: This extension is for Mobirise bootstrap 4 projects (AMP not supported). 

Once the block configuration is accessed via the "gear" (cog) icon, all the configuration options are avaiable (see screenshot in link above).

Earlier Versions: Prior to v2.6, a zip file containing a small Mobirise 4.x bootstrap project (created using the Mobirise 4 theme as the base project) was provided. To use the menu, users had to download the zip file, unzip contents to a folder and import into Mobirise as a new project by selecting the "project.mobirise" file for the import process. users could then save the menu from the imported project as a Mobirise "user block" and move between Mobirise bootstrap 4 projects (AMP not supported).
