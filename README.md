## <b>Blocks in the extension</b><br>

This bootstrap extension (mbrext) currently contians two blocks. More maybe added in the future.

<b>BLOCK 1. MobiGary Configurable Mobirise Bootstrap Menu</b><br><br>
A Mobirise Bootstrap menu with many configuration settings available from the "gear" configuration icon. It includes:
- Individual colour and opacity settings for Main, Sub and Hamburger menu background.
- Individual underline colour and thickness for main and sub-menu plus sub-menu % darken on hover.
- Options to enable Buttons, Social icons and Brand Name text within the menu plus controls set the dispaly area width of each.
- Set Logo size & Set logo size when scrolling down page options.
- Allows alignment of main menu when is desktop mode to eitehr left, center or right. Menu item spacing slider also provided.
- Menu underline options.
- Main Menu and Sub Menu underline options.
- Sub Menu rounded corner optons.
- Main and Sub Menu Box shadow (inner and outer) options.
- A top line message - with various configuration options available.

In summary, you can configure more options on the gear icon than you can with the standard menus. This was a personal training exercise for me to configure gear items and also upload to GitHub.
